        "No input validation on context parameter - could accept None or non-string types",

      "summary": "Code is functionally correct with good separation of concerns and clear logic flow. The prompt generation functions work as intended, and the configuration dictionaries are well-structured. However, there are minor robustness issues around input validation and data structure consistency that could cause runtime errors in edge cases."
